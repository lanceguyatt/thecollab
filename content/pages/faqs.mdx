## Do we need to book a table?

We would thoroughly recommend it, its a guaranteed avenue to instant happiness!   We operate a waiting list at busy periods so you can join the queue and be notified when a table is available. We always try to accommodate everyone in a timely fashion. If you would like to book a table, just follow the link above. 

## Can we come in just for drinks?

Absolutely. We’re as much a bar as we are a restaurant.  We have 16 keg beers on draught at any given time, including Signature Brew’s award-winning core range and a host of specials from breweries around the world. We also have fully-stocked fridges offering cans and bottles and alcohol-free options. We also have an excellent selection of wines, spirits and soft drinks to meet everyone’s tastes.
